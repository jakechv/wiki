However, this is a very small part of what it is like to be me.
Can be trapped in thoughts: these thoughts feel hard to get away from.
Before this, stand apart from your thoughts; distance yourself from them.
Focus on what you see.
Have some simple, sentence-style thoughts. Think of things that are
completely emotionally uncharged; thoughts that do not connect to strong
ideas.
Do not sink completely into the thought.
Realize that your thoughts change as you take in different parts of your
environment. Most of your experience is not comprised by this thought.</span></p><p><span>Step back from the thoughts that are happening. Do not be so enraptured by
them.</span></p><p><span>Prod some of these thoughts: how long does it take for the thoughts to go by?
How heavy is the thought?
Can you stop that thought and let it go or is there something that happens
when you try to do that?</span></p><p><span>Focus your attention on a single thought. Close your eyes. What do you feel
about it? Is this a solid object or ethereal? Is it well-defined or is it
indistinct?</span></p><p><span>By dropping your intention in, you are able to feel past your layer of
intention and analyze what has not been processed.</span></p><p><span>Do not have an agenda when inquiring about this sensation. Learn more about
the sensation.</span></p><p><span>The actual sensation is neutral; it is your interpretation of the situation
that is making it negative. It's very important to realize this.</span></p><p><span>Blow evaluates a particularly painful experience -- food poisoning -- and how
he can separate his understanding of the pain and their reaction to it.</span></p><p><span>We know this about pain! When we are cut, the nerve receives an impulse and
this impulse is recieved by the brain, which assigns negative sentiment to
these things.</span></p><p><span>Look at the sensations that help you generate this negative state.</span></p><p><span>There is probably some legitimage precedence for having developed a habit, or
a response; at some point, though, we must acknowledge that these processes
are not inherently necessary! We can then properly evaluate and control
whether we make decisions based on this state.</span></p><p><span>Always pinpoint the source of your emotions, whether positive or negative.
You are not your thoughts. Your thoughts are very small.
Step back.
Sensations are neutral. Your mind amplifies the sensations.
Try evaluating negative exercises as neutral experiences.</span></p></section></div></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="the-good-life"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>The Good Life</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="finding-motivation"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Finding Motivation</span></span></h2><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="the-lesson-to-unlearn"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>The Lesson TO Unlearn</span></span></h3><section><p><a class="firn-external" href="http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html" target="_blank">paul graham</a><span>

Startups don't take off by themselves -- the founders make them take off.</span></p><p><span>By yourself:</span></p><ol><li><p><span>Recruit users manually.
   To grow your business naturally, you need to recruit! Aggresively!
   Shyness and laziness prevent people from doing this; wanting to write code
   and seeing the small numbers of users. Those initial users are necessary
   for exponential growth!</span></p></li><li><p><span>Get used to fragility. It's hard to balance a successful business, and
   squeezing the margins will make hte difference between success and failure.
   All startups are fragile! New startups can't be judged by the standards of
   successful ones.
   It's okay to get things wrong. It's okay to fix things.
   It's hard to see where you're coming from.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Delight. Don't just get users, make them happy! Make users know that
   signing up with you is the best thing they could have done. Try too hard
   to make your customers happy.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Experience. The user experience and quality of execution should be
   incredible. The product doesn't have to be great, but the experience of
   being a user does. Over-engage with initial users, listen to them
   carefully and pay close attention to their opinions.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Fire. Focus on a deliberately narrow market at first, then widen your
   breadth. Start with a subset of the market then quickly expand.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Consult. Pick a single, initial user and use them as a mold for a user to
   please. Recruit initial lukewarm users by using your software on their behalf
   and perfect the user experience and theri end.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Manual. You are your software. Do everything manually, then automate it
   later! This enables a faster launch, and automating out of this loop becomes
   trivial.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Big. Don't do the big launch! Nobody remembers it! Need something
   unscalably laborious.</span></p></li></ol></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="satisfaction-in-work"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Satisfaction in Work</span></span></h3><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="deep-work:-jon-blow"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Deep Work: Jon Blow</span></span></h4><section><p><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ej_3NKA3pk&amp;app=desktop" target="_blank">talk</a><span>
Though all software feels different, at the root of it all this all feels the
same.
The ideas you initially have will not be that deep; as such, the exciting
things are at the surface level. First, understand the single exciting idea
and explore it.
Initial actions primarily focus on working with the surface-level code;
determine how to navigate the code, working with code at a top level. We need
to focus on learning how to communicate to the computer!</span></p><p><span>Experienced programmers do not think about text; text is the application of a
drawn-out idea and a developed solution. A problem is decomposed into
smaller, tractale problems, then these tractable problems can be translated
into code that has been approached before.</span></p><p><span>The shape doesn't start anywhere! After having an idea, yo also need to
locate this starting point; from this starting point, you must then locate a
way from which you can navigate through the idea from this point. Not finding
the starting point is bad, worse than choosing the wrong starting point!</span></p><p><span>Some moments of programming involve internalizing a task so far that it's
been practiced; after performing this task so many times, you become
accustomed to translating this task into code without thinking about it! This
experience is incredibly powerful!</span></p><p><span>This is more like an art than an engineering -- you are following an
intuition, and this intuition carries you somewhere good!</span></p><p><span>Often, we get trapped by our attention: if we are deeply focused on a single
way of thinking and operating at a level of abstraction, we are unable to
switch contexts to another layer of abstraction very easily! Often it's best
to back up and reevaluate the big picture.</span></p><p><span>Getting to the deep work comes from experience. You'll follow many misguided
paths and many ill-guided directions, but at the end of the day you will
reach a deeper understanding of the topic at hand.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="philosophy-in-life"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Philosophy in Life</span></span></h3><section><p><a class="firn-external" href="https://hoanhan101.github.io/2020/04/26/guide-to-the-good-life" target="_blank">finding the good life</a><span>

Concentrate. Do one thing at a time! Exceptional work is associated with
periods of deep concentration and focus.
Always have a clear purpose. Why does it matter? How is it applicabl to my
life? How can it help me achieve my goals?
Apply creativity to everything you learn! Make learning more fun, engage more
senses, and grant actions to images.
Long-term memory can trap short-term information:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Car method: use the car and store new information in parts of the car</span></p></li><li><p><span>Peg method: use rhyming words to store ordered information</span></p></li><li><p><span>Developing a storyline: create a relationship between the known and the

We are most well set up for learning to fit into our cultures and navigate
them socially.
We are often not able to think well enough to see that we are not thinking
well enough! This is the Dunning-Kruger effect.
It's known that we can only deal with a small number of things at once; we
must limit the input we receive and focus only on the core idea at hand.</span></p><p><span>"You can't thinking about thinking without thinking about something." -

that require better procedures; then, navigating those procedures assist you
