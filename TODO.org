#+TITLE: Todo
* TODO Add CI
- Currently the site is built on the client side
- Add a CI configuration to build the site on upload
* TODO Add 'Edit on GitHub' button
- Dependent on CI
- Allows others to open PRs and edit content from GitHub
  that is then directly added to the site (and incorporated, via CI)
* TODO Convert links to archive.org references on push
this way i'll actually have them in the future
should be part of a CI job or something; maybe locally in the editor? could take a lot of time though.
* TODO dynamically fetch and insert titles into .org files
this way i dont have to retype the title, as i do most of the time.
easier to just go back and change it than to have to manually add the title
* TODO remove personal info
some config to prevent pages with personal info from showing in public wiki,
but allowing me to browse them freely locally
