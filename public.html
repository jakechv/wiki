There is nothing wrong with day jobs! Some really enjoy them.
If the job is right for you, that's wonderful.</span></p><p><span>If the day job is not right for you, learn on your own.</span></p><p><span>"It is in the employee's personal insterest to stop selling hours of labor
and start renting access to his accumulated capital as soon as humanly possible."</span></p><p><span>In other words, to become valuable, you must accumulate valuable experience,
hard skills and trust, then leverage these to continue to be constructive.</span></p><p><span>If you end the week with nothing, nothing about your life will change!
No matter how hard you work you'll come back the next week having built another
internal product or having worked with another internal system. This
is not valuable to you, and as a student you should prefer pursuing things you benefit from.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="tips"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Tips</span></span></h2><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="work-where-people-can-see-you"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Work where people can see you.</span></span></h3><section><p><span>  This is not exactly the same as 'working in public'.
