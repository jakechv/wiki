  Ironically, their rubber logo patch is thicker than the wallet

  (Close second: Uni Kuru Toga. Designs are worse and it's harder to use
  the pencil to sketch, but the rotating tip is a killer idea.)</span></p></li><li><p><span>Pen :: Fisher Space Pen (with clip!)

  Incredible looking bulky shoes.
  As comfortable as dad shoes but still accrue a ton of compliments.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Daily :: Nike x Stone Island Sock Dart - Black
  The sillhouette of these shoes is enough to appear professional -
  I've gotten and attended interviews in these sneakers! - but they're
  still casual and comfortable enough to wear daily and outside of the office.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Workout :: Adidas Boost Something

  Great all-around pant. They look formal dressed up

  The Schoeller Dryskin fabric is killer.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Travel / Comfort :: Enfin Leve Aldatze
  Baggy, futuristic pants that are super comfortable.
  I feel great wearing these everywhere and they look incredible.
  Again, the Schoeller Dryskin fabric is killer.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Lounge :: Issey Miyake Homme Plisse Lounge Pants
  These pants are weightless and look luxurious.
  The appearance of the pleats is unmatched.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>I wear other pants as well but they pale in comparison to these.
I'm looking into pants from Outlier and Veilance as well,
but I haven't had the opportunity to try them and they do not seem

  Perfect jacket. Super flexible and waterproof. Comes with the hood.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Hoodie :: Cav Empt Heavy Hoodie - white stripe.
  This hoodie fits my body type perfectly like no other hoodie I've tried has.
  I wish the hoodie were a bit lighter so I could wear it in sunnier weather
  and so it was more portable but the cut of the garment is unparalleled.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>The other jackets I typically bring with me are a Y-3 SS14 'Light Jacket' for
lighter weather and an Adidas x Reigning Champ sample oversized Coach Jacket.
I love the look of both but in terms of utility they are super interchangeable --
they add some variety to the closet, but I could live without them if need be.
I also have a cropped sweater from Urban Outfitters but that should be swapped out
for something higher quality as well for more formal settings.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="portable-formalwear"><span class="firn-headline-keyword firn-headline-keyword__TODO">TODO </span><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Portable Formalwear</span></span></h2><section><p><span>I'd like something weatherproof that won't stand out in a more formal setting.
This is something I'd also use as a layering piece over the hoodie when the
weather is rough but I don't need or want something heavy duty.
Veilance has made a variety of different overcoats and formal jackets
that fit this description, but I'd like to try different options in store
before committing to one.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="tech"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Tech</span></span></h1><section><ul><li><p><span>Laptop :: Dell XPS 13
  This laptop is okay.
  I like the size and it's gotten me through school, but I
  wish it had better Linux compatibility and better battery
  life in the long term. The build quality could be better too.
  Upgrade: likely Thinkpad X1 Carbon.</span></p><p><span>  Another consideration I have is bringing around a smaller computer

  plugging this computer into monitors docked at my workspaces as needed.

  I love this camera.
  It gives me the same control I enjoy from film cameras but in a
  light, portable, digital body. Lens selection is plentiful and lenses
  are small enough to be portable.
  Lenses:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>23mm F2 WR</span></p></li></ul><p><span>  Strap: DSPTCH Camera Wrist Strap</span></p></li><li><p><span>Smartphone :: Samsung Galaxy S9

  I wish the bag were lighter and offered more organization,
