Title: Long-form Texts on Interesting Details of Computers
Date: Wed, 15 Apr 2020 18:00:00 -0400
Link: https://deterministic.space/several-months-of-reading-material.html</span></p><p><span>It seems especially recently I’ve come across more and more long-form texts
(think: hour-long blog posts; free books; series of posts). I especially like
the ones that go into the very fine details of some niche topic and maybe also
ramble a bit about completely unrelated but highly entertaining asides. And
while I will probably never have enough time to read them all, I decided to at
least collect some of them here for future reference. I’ll do my best to add
summaries, and to update this list semi-regularly.</span></p><p><span>Contents</span></p><ul><li><p><span>“Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists” by Alexis Beingessner[1]</span></p></li><li><p><span>“Programming Algorithms” by Vsevolod Domkin[2]</span></p></li><li><p><span>“Aspects of Rust” by multiple people[3]</span></p></li><li><p><span>“Reading files the hard way” by Amos Wenger[4]</span></p></li><li><p><span>“Making our own ping” by Amos Wenger[5]</span></p></li><li><p><span>“Making our own executable packer” by Amos Wenger[6]</span></p></li><li><p><span>“Parsing” by Aleksey Kladov[7]</span></p></li><li><p><span>“JavaScript Allongé” by Reg “raganwald” Braithwaite[8]</span></p></li><li><p><span>“Crafting Interpreters” by Robert Nystrom[9]</span></p></li><li><p><span>“A relatively simple Datalog engine in Rust” by Frank McSherry[10]</span></p></li><li><p><span>“Non-lexical lifetimes” by Niko Matsakis[11]</span></p></li><li><p><span>“Shifgrethor” by Without Boats[12]</span></p></li><li><p><span>“Rayon/Parallel Iterators” by Niko Matsakis[13]</span></p></li><li><p><span>“How Rust optimizes async/await” by Tyler Mandry[14]</span></p></li><li><p><span>“Writing an OS in Rust” by Philipp Oppermann[15]</span></p></li><li><p><span>“Learning Parser Combinators With Rust” by Bodil Stokke[16]</span></p></li><li><p><span>“Manish vs. ASCII” by Manish Goregaokar[17]</span></p></li><li><p><span>“The Wayland Protocol” by Drew DeVault[18]</span></p></li></ul><p><span>“Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists[19]” by Alexis Beingessner</span></p><p><span>(~180 pages; archived[20])</span></p><p><span>The premise of this book is that writing a linked list is a beginner’s exercise
in C but quite difficult to get right in Rust. So it takes that as an
opportunity to do just what the title says: It teaches you Rust by implementing
a linked list type in Rust, in five (as of April 2020) different ways.</span></p><p><span>Niches: data structures; linked lists; rust; smart pointers</span></p><p><span>Last update I saw: 2019-03-21</span></p><p><span>“Programming Algorithms[21]” by Vsevolod Domkin</span></p><p><span>(~300 pages; archived[22])</span></p><p><span>Book covering a lot of different data structures and algorithms. “Its aim is to

    ways Rust tries to represent them in a nice roundabout way.

    your function to return, the compiler can go back and fill in the blanks.
