The system has some interesting ideas like validating requests, queries, HTML and SQL, and has an inbuilt ORM for expressing database interactions.
It's also super easy to install with Nix!</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, it's software developed on master without rigorous testing practices and the documentation can be lacking at times (though it is very good for a research effort). In my limited time using the framework, I found that I would frequently struggle with errors related to bad parses; if I used the wrong syntax at some point, I would receive an error that felt incredibly inconsistent with the code I was writing - I wish the system had more logging to inform the user of where the error occurs at the least!</span></p><p><span>It's also clear that the framework operates entirely independent of any progress in the web development space -- which leads to some interesting ideas but foregoes several nice-to-haves of current systems. Urweb, though, is in it for the long haul.</span></p><p><span>Ur/web </span><strong><span>does</span></strong><span> seem to have decent Emacs support, though I had some initial trouble getting urweb-mode to run in Emacs out of the box.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="starting-out"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Starting Out</span></span></h1><section><p><span>If you're starting and you're a beginner, don't bother with the manual at first. Install the `urweb` package with Nix (use a nix-shell!) and jump straight to the examples. I found that without the proper context the manual and reference weren't super useful; they focus on the programming language itself rather than the ecosystem surrounding web development, which is likely why you're using the framework.</span></p><p><span>Of course, once you're familiar with using the ecosystem, go back to the reference to learn more about the language!</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="links"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Links</span></span></h1><section><p><a class="firn-external" href="https://github.com/urweb/urweb" target="_blank">the Urweb repository</a><span></span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.impredicative.com/ur/demo/" target="_blank">the main demo as provided in the repo</a><span></span><a class="firn-external" href="http://frigoeu.github.io/urweb1.html" target="_blank">a great writeup on why urweb is worth trying</a><span>
