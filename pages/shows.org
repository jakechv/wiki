#+TITLE: Shows

Shows I've seen!

Yes, this includes anime.

* Queen's Gambit
Beautifully done 1950's woman empowerment - but not about woman - genius character develops into a star and navigates relationships with a pragmatic view of the world but desparate one of the past.
* FLCL
aka Fooly Cooly
2000s anime; I love the soundtrack but the plot is nonsensical or entirely absent.
* Neon Genesis Evangelion
Absolutely beatiful series. Killer opening theme that doesn't fit the show at all. The pacing and visuals are artful; entirely different from any comparable series.
