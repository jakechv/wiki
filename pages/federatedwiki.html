<h2>Wikipedia</h2>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single source of truth: it's a trustworthy source. People know to get their data from here.</li>
<li>Tons of information. Crowdsourcing has done the</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because it's a single source of truth, there are constant fights over what belongs where that are often fruitless.</li>
<li>There are also strong arguments that are made for information being 'out of scope' for wikipedia and belonging to a page or site that is more domain specific.</li>
<li>The organization is bloated and inneficient. They really don't need your donations.</li>
<li>The servers are centralized and controlled by a single private entity with the potenial to hold data (partially - sans clever parsers) captive.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wikia</h2>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tons of information with moderators who are experts on their domains.</li>
<li>Dedicated contributors, existing communities, easy to edit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Divided into lots of different wikis with no interoperability between them.</li>
<li>Tons of overlap between wikis (i.e. multiple star wars and minecraft ones, among other franchises and tropes)</li>
<li>Typically used for casual and hobby interests rather than professional writing and work - why?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal wiki implementation</h2>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super flexible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not a consistent or reliable source of information, as it's typically controlled by one person.</li>
<li>Can be disorganized and things can easily become unmaintained.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version control managed files</h2>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built-in consensus algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concurrent modification hurts.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Goals</h1>
<ul>
<li>Decentralized: share information from many sources without being controlled by any of them</li>
<li>Open: should incorporate as many sources of knowledge as possible, and individual wikis should have tons of agency.</li>
<li>Easy to use: it should be incredibly easy to contribute to and communicate with some sort of central wiki.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Information Sources</h2>
<p>In order of priority:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wikia sites (there are tons!)</li>
<li>Wikipedia</li>
<li>wiki.c2.org</li>
<li>Assorted third party wikis.</li>
<li>[perhaps] personal wikis</li>
<li>etcâ€¦</li>
</ol>
<p>Fusing all of the Wikia sites into a single, cohesive wiki seems incredibly useful.</p>
<h2>Feature Ideas</h2>
<dl>
<dt>shared &amp; enhanced pages</dt>
<dd>fuse pages that cover similar or related topics together into one view.
</dd>
<dt>consensus</dt>
<dd>condense and share overlapping information, reducing the amount of duplication.
</dd>
<dt>interoperable</dt>
<dd>shift from one wiki to another easily.
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>Wiki IR related decentralized wiki idea (what we were talking about in chat, but not really what is above)</h1>
<ul>
<li>uses wiki IR standard to link together many peoples personal wikis</li>
<li>there is an engine at the center (or several?) that crawl the wikiverse and attempt to bring together pages that are similar
<ul>
<li>when pages are similar (by AI?, NLP measure), suggest several types of merging
<ul>
<li>suggestion ways
<ul>
<li>as part of wiki IR cli tool display suggestions</li>
<li>make tiny website dashbaord backed by small webapp that phones to recomender engine</li>
</ul></li>
<li>types of page merging (between peoples federated wiki)
<ul>
<li>link at the bottom of page to other pages with similar content (like webring)</li>
<li>transclude entire other page to bottom of your page (and vice versa, both pages in the link transclude eachother)</li>
<li>suggest that pages are merged using git-esque strategy (pull request, text diff/merge tools like mergely)
<ul>
<li>q: where does consenus page live? on neither page? (next to ai engines) on one page? (one of the merge requesters 'wins', one conceceds), or both (they share :))</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>goals of merging
<ul>
<li>reduce information duplication</li>
<li>instead of conflicts of information being resolved in backchannel of wikipedia, consensus arguments are disputed publicly through pull requests and accepted/rejected page links</li>
<li>epic and cool</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1>Conversation linking</h1>
<ul>
<li>make conversations first class primitive of wiki, so that concepts are linked to discussion in which they are conceived</li>
<li>can be as simple as citations linking to specific conversations</li>
<li>uses matrix? hard part is technical challenge of implementation</li>
</ul>
<h1>Backlink fixing</h1>
<ul>
<li>move/rename pages and update backlinks</li>
</ul>
<h1>Automatically backup videos/external sites</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bibanon/tubeup">https://github.com/bibanon/tubeup</a></li>
<li>like gwern, to prevent linkrot</li>
</ul>
<h1>Provide tools to make good public/private separation</h1>
<ul>
<li>so that people can have shareable personal wiki concepts/reference pages, while also having extremely messy private brainstorming (brainstorming=unformed,errorfull,shameless,indulgently bad, creative, risky)/exobrain wiki pages.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Syntax that is not static/markup</h1>
<ul>
<li>I want a markup syntax like (move [otherpage]: " this concept deserves to be in other page, but right now i am in [firstpage] and don't want to move all the way to otherpage in emacs so im gonna write this thought in a move block: this thought")
<ul>
<li>and that will append that thought to the bottom of other page once i save or run tool or something (linter?)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1>Smart todo aggregation system</h1>
<ul>
<li>dokuwiki has decent one,</li>
<li>zimwiki also has some good features (like hiding todo until certain date)</li>
</ul>
<h1>New types of syntax</h1>
<ul>
<li>some syntax for assigning how sure you are of an idea, or how much you like it
<ul>
<li>font size???!</li>
<li>number of exclamation points vs question marks !!!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1>First class support for sorting lists</h1>
<ul>
<li>idk how this would work but interactive sorting is underrated!!!</li>
</ul>
<h1>Visualizers</h1>
<ul>
<li>like roam/logseq/etc.</li>
<li>but if they want to use those interactively, just use them and use wiki IR to convert wiki to them</li>
<li>maybe support something simple like</li>
</ul>
<h1>WIKI LSP</h1>
<ul>
<li>breadcrumbs (<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wu4kP.png">https://i.stack.imgur.com/wu4kP.png</a>)</li>
<li>definition/lookup. like you can name concepts and hover for definitions?</li>
<li>autocompletion of other page names</li>
</ul></body></html>
