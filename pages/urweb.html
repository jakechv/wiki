<p>Ur/Web, or the Ur programming language and the Ur/Web domain-specific language standard and library, is an ecosystem designed to promote <strong>very</strong> safe <a href="./web.org">web</a> development. The system has some interesting ideas like validating requests, queries, HTML and SQL, and has an inbuilt ORM for expressing database interactions. It's also super easy to install with Nix!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's software developed on master without rigorous testing practices and the documentation can be lacking at times (though it is very good for a research effort). In my limited time using the framework, I found that I would frequently struggle with errors related to bad parses; if I used the wrong syntax at some point, I would receive an error that felt incredibly inconsistent with the code I was writing - I wish the system had more logging to inform the user of where the error occurs at the least!</p>
<p>It's also clear that the framework operates entirely independent of any progress in the web development space â€“ which leads to some interesting ideas but foregoes several nice-to-haves of current systems. Urweb, though, is in it for the long haul.</p>
<p>Ur/web <strong>does</strong> seem to have decent Emacs support, though I had some initial trouble getting urweb-mode to run in Emacs out of the box.</p>
<h1>Starting Out</h1>
<p>If you're starting and you're a beginner, don't bother with the manual at first. Install the `urweb` package with Nix (use a nix-shell!) and jump straight to the examples. I found that without the proper context the manual and reference weren't super useful; they focus on the programming language itself rather than the ecosystem surrounding web development, which is likely why you're using the framework.</p>
<p>Of course, once you're familiar with using the ecosystem, go back to the reference to learn more about the language!</p>
