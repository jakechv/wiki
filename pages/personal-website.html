One of my favorite pastimes is browsing these sites and trying to learn more about the people behind them.</p>

<h1>Inspiration</h1>
<h2>Animated</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zzh8829/zihao">https://github.com/zzh8829/zihao</a> has an excellent game on his website that involves placing blocks in various places, build with a combination of hugo and node. uses tween.js to show some great animations working!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.zx2c4.com/#">https://www.zx2c4.com/#</a> :: Love that this fetches projects from git as well as shows a scrolling interface through their source code. I should make a website like this to showcase my own projects via the github api! See <a href="https://github.com/jakeisnt/projects">https://github.com/jakeisnt/projects</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/xdesro/vogue">https://github.com/xdesro/vogue</a> :: There is so much dynamism here! Very enjoyable to interact with.</li>
<li><a href="https://tatianamac.com/">https://tatianamac.com/</a> :: Lots fo detail but none of it is distracting. So many important articles!</li>
<li><a href="https://willcrichton.net/#">https://willcrichton.net/#</a> :: It's a personal website that's playable inside a game boy! This is a major motivation for me to work on this wiki platform – I want a single source of truth for all of my web spaces, but I also want to be able to render different representations of my website depending on how I'd like to display it at any given time. The question is, though, how I should best separate these concerns!</li>
<li><a href="http://umru.pcmusic.info/">http://umru.pcmusic.info/</a> :: This rendered animation in the background is… a lot.</li>
<li><a href="https://simone.computer/#/">https://simone.computer/#/</a> :: Just incredible! Like an old windows machine, complete with animated screensaver if the user stops browsing for awhile.</li>
<li><a href="http://eeerik.com/">http://eeerik.com/</a> :: Another web portal; this feels so much more modern. I love the idea of developing little applets and running them inside the web portal. The bootup page is fantastic as well!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Beyond web</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ameyama.com/hey">novel design!</a> a website that interfaces with a physical device, a pi, and flashes a smiley face whenever someone visits the page. lends some personal, physical characteristics to an otherwise void webspace. they also have very good book recommendations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Minimal</h2>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://mikhailkhoury.com/">http://mikhailkhoury.com/</a></dt>
<dd>I patterned my current website after mikhail's. It's incredibly minimal and feels mysterious and personal at the same time.
</dd>
<dt><a href="http://ryanhileman.com/">http://ryanhileman.com/</a></dt>
<dd>No CSS! Super communicative with brief descriptions of all of their projects and interests. There is no mystery to what they've made.
</dd>
<dt><a href="http://ryandoeng.es/">http://ryandoeng.es/</a></dt>
<dd>"And the gears notch and the engines wheel."<a href="academia.org">Academia</a>
</dd>
<dt><a href="https://omar.yt/">https://omar.yt/</a></dt>
<dd>incredibly simple. super easy to read their website just by looking at it. wish there were more substance though…
</dd>
<dt><a href="https://shifrakhan.com/">https://shifrakhan.com/</a></dt>
<dd>the minimalism speaks to a lot of their accomplishments; seems like a very impressive person.
</dd>
<dt><a href="https://craze.co.uk/">https://craze.co.uk/</a></dt>
<dd>They fille the space incredibly well with this design, even though it's clearly designed with minimalism in mind. Love that navigation and 'back' are entirely built into the site. Try this out for a personal website sometime.
</dd>
<dt><a href="http://charlix.cx/">http://charlix.cx/</a></dt>
<dd>This is incredible! The website is <strong>blurry</strong>. Figure out how this is accomplished!
</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/">http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/</a></dt>
<dd>That ascii art is beautiful. I love how much dynamism it adds to their website without having to introduce any graphics. I wonder if there's some way to generate cool ascii art to showcase on different websites…
</dd>
<dt><a href="https://ofcr.se/">https://ofcr.se/</a></dt>
<dd>Phrased introduction similar to my website but with much more information on it. It's worth considering adding more words to mine; this reads very well.
</dd>
<dt><a href="https://ariellam.com/">https://ariellam.com/</a></dt>
<dd>I love the frames! This website has some excellent design work behind it.
</dd>
<dt><a href="https://inns.studio/">https://inns.studio/</a></dt>
<dd>This isn't exactly javascript minimal, but the scrolling feels incredible here.
</dd>

<h2>Resume-Like</h2>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://2d4.dev/">https://2d4.dev/</a></dt>
<dd>I love the look of this. It feels just like a resume, but it's able to accurately and properly communicate all of their interests, projects and accomplishments!
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Quirky/Novel</h2>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/diracdeltas/random-training">https://github.com/diracdeltas/random-training</a></dt>
<dd>A bit of a sloppy site that generates random training workouts. Love the slapped together aesthetic that feels both quick and deliberate; if it weren't purposeful, there would certainly be more padding issues.
</dd>
<dt><a href="https://niksethi.com/">https://niksethi.com/</a></dt>
<dd>This website is a conversation - a choose your own adventure that walks the reader through their accomplishments! Great work.
</dd>

<dd>The personal website as a dungeon crawler.
</dd>

<h2>Blog</h2>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://paco.sh/blog">https://paco.sh/blog</a></dt>
<dd>Nice layout here; great font and spacing. Love the light interaction hovering over each article. Shows just the right amount of information with good enough padding.
