* TODO programming tax
higher level languages are built to help the programmer focus on higher level ideas,
protecting them from thinking about memory permissions, etc. this is the case most of the time
but all abstractions are at some point leaky given our finite access to memory and compute.

javascript does not accomplish this; it merely shifts the responsibilities of the programmer
operating at lower levels of abstraction from thinking about pointers, memory mapping, etc.
to thinking about undefined, NaN and object comparisons instead .

proper abstraction enables the programmer to think at a higher level; javascript comes close
before dragging the developer down with it
