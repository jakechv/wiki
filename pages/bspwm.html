<p>By default, it opens windows in a pattern resembling the Fibonacci sequence, but it's an incredibly configurable platform that a variety of others have written tools for.</p>
<p>It doesn't control its own keymappings; messaging is managed entirely by `bspc`. Users typically also use XHKD to map keys for the window manager.</p>
