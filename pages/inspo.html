<h1>Tools for Better Thinking</h1>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23339830">thread</a> The most underrated problem solving tool is to type out and explain your thought process. Start writing down questions to ask others; as you explain what you have tried, you will begin to realize that there are more things left to try – some of which being potential solutions.</p>
<p>Type your question into StackOverflow to submit; you'll be fearful of asking the question.</p>
<p>Rank factors; always express factors as positive attributes. After generating the table, the longest continuous line of check marks for each factor determines the choice (though this can be gamed…)</p>
<p>State charts: easy to reason about state changes without the explosion of state machines. These are hierarchical state machines, in a sense.</p>
<p>The Inversion Methods: The solution to many hard problems can be clarified by re-expressing them in inverse form.</p>
<p>Crossline: structure your thoughts as you type and make cross-references.</p>

Interfacing with js and node results in conflitts between es and js versions, node incompatibilities, differnet import syntax in different circumstances, etc. it's painful. How do you import with node? without node? &lt;script&gt; tag or not to script? Where did the node modules go? This is a good rant of questions and things to feature on the wbesite</p>

<h1>anxiety in product development</h1>
<p><a href="https://andreschweighofer.com/agile/anxiety-in-product-development/">https://andreschweighofer.com/agile/anxiety-in-product-development/</a> anxiety can emerge easily from stress, resulting in anger, frustration and other unhealthy forms of exerting such stress. this impacts other people, organizations and processes as well. we have fear driven development : a concrete idea encouraging us to avoid certain practices depending upon the specific approach</p>
<p>play to win, don't play not to lose; developing a unique selling proposition means that you are no longer fighting with others, but rather striving to come out ahead</p>
<p>awareness of such anxiety is the first step to take. with this awareness comes conscious decision making, and with such decisions come wiser product crafting and, in the end, better, more creative work</p>
