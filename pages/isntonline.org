#+TITLE: Isntonline

organization
* manifesto
we have the right to live local first,
without internet connections,
without information tracking,
without constant distraction.

we believe that software should build and work everywhere, empowering the user to use it as they please - but that the user experience should be offlune first.

we believe in:
- powerful data standards
- downloading once, never again
- operating with minimal resources
- building once, running everywhere

  first draft lol
