* What you'll wish you'd known
- It's hard to decide what job you want
- You don't learn in high school waht to do with your life
- Work forward from promising situations rather than working backwards from a goal:
  this ensures that you're using your time efficiently!
- 'Stay upwind' -> 'work on hard problems'. Treat school like a day job, work at your passions at night. You're wasting far too much time agonizing and procrastinating anyways.
