<h1>manifesto</h1>
<p>we have the right to live local first, without internet connections, without information tracking, without constant distraction.</p>
<p>we believe that software should build and work everywhere, empowering the user to use it as they please - but that the user experience should be offlune first.</p>
<p>we believe in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>powerful data standards</p></li>
<li><p>downloading once, never again</p></li>
<li><p>operating with minimal resources</p></li>
<li><p>building once, running everywhere</p>
<p>first draft lol</p></li>
</ul>
