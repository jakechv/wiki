** Akira
Worth all of the hype. A seminal cyberpunk fantasy with animation that still feels like it's from the future. There's no need for exposition because the story tells itself.
** Goodfellas
Great narrative -- clearly inspired movies like the wolf of wall street ans catch me if you can, among others.
** Monty Python and the Holy Grail
** Taxi Driver
