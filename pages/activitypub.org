#+TITLE: ActivityPub

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/activitypub/gh-pages/activitypub-tutorial.txt][A good explanation of how the protocol works.]]

* Research
1. host local servers, one tracking each service
2. connect to these servers with a locally hosted mastodon client
3. each server takes account information and mocks external accounts:
   - logs in through social media api
   - view posts, corresponding threads/comments sections
   - server publishes data form these services in real time to mastodon
   - server creates/tracks fake mastodon user from every other user
   - these users are visible with clever naming scheme and tolerated by
     server
   - interacting with these real servers from ur acct (must be hosted in same
     place) == ur account on that social media interacting with their real
     acct
   - likes, follows etc. also emulated -- though have to check if current
     user is following them, has liked, has followed etc.

   - should port over images, videos, gifs etc from whatever proprietary
     twitter thing they use to sane default formats to display on mastodon
     (i guess these should be cached for some time period, then...)

want to avoid static ip, ideally
- run on home server, always-on computer kind of deal ie beaglebone
- NAT TOR? Zooko's triangle -- choosing between human readable, decentralized and unique is impossible. PetNames proposal may be useful
- key upgrade, but all that is needed is tor .onion address support, truly
