<p>Programs with a Terminal UI are written to function without the use of a graphical user interface, enabling easy access to desktop environments with tools such as SSH.</p>
<p>Some choose to use their system in an entirely TUI-based fashion with programs such as vim, mutt and tmux. Unfortunately, many websites and web-based programs are not usable without a graphical user interface,</p>
