<p>analyzing myself life logging is super important what things am i interested in processing? <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/my-data.html#emfit">source</a></p>
<p><a href="https://activitywatch.net/">https://activitywatch.net/</a> good resource for tracking <a href="https://blog.jethro.dev/posts/self_tracking_in_plain_text/">Jethro's self tracking in plain text</a></p>
<p>doing things digitally automatically logs data for the timeline feels wrong that data can be forgotten and lost forever want to have the choice whether to forget or remember, and want to be able to access forgotten memories</p>
<p>ultimately, i want this to be an effort to accomplish two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>reduce the services i use</li>
<li>connect all of the services i use</li>
</ul>
<p>and i want to be able to interface with all of them</p>
<p>eventually, i would like to be able to open this ecosystem to others, and in doing so allow people to share events, memories and experiences</p>
