<p>Tmux is a terminal multiplexer, allowing one to track multiple groups of terminals and terminal environments in a<a href="../concepts/terminal_ui.org"> Terminal UI</a> application.</p>
<p>It's most often used as a window manager on Unix-based systems without a GUI in conjunction with programs like <a href="vim.html">Vim</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the tmux configuration language is very limited, but it provides the right facilities for keymapping and managing windows.</p>
