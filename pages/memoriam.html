<p>I want to replicate the feeling of memory.</p>
<h1>Rationale</h1>
<p>Memories are temporary. Memories fade.</p>
<p>Today, we're empowered with several tools to prevent this. We have devices that constantly track our locations and monitor our activity. I want to use these tools to allow us to travel through our past.</p>
<p>I want to replicate the feeling of walking down a familiar road and seeing a place we have a particularly fond memory of, but in the digital world. Moreover, I want to be able to share this experience with others who may not have lived the same life experiences I have had, and to be able to link across experiences between people.</p>
<p>Further, I'd like to add a nostalgic aspect that we do not often feel in the real world – one spent on the internet.</p>
<p>(This isn't a very good name… it should be catchier.)</p>
<h1>Information</h1>
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Location stamped photos/videos</li>
<li>Notes on photos</li>
<li>Textual links for every point</li>
</ul>
<p>Not everything has to be linked to a location, but most browsing is location-based.</p>
<h1>Rough Idea</h1>
<h2>Temporal View</h2>
<p>Cutscenes happen like a video game with fast travel. Pressing 'play' on a day starts with a map and a first location. It will zoom in when digital activ</p>
<h2>Spacial View</h2>
<p>Visit location -&gt; see everything visible in that location. A lot of this is already handled by Google Maps. You should be able to enter the other views from here so that viewing a location can trigger a memory.</p>
<h2>Textual View</h2>
<p>This is a traditional dictionary view. It puts text notes first and allows for the browsing of linked information, much like other dictionaries. I'd like a view that operates similar to my wiki.</p>
