of the old wooden bench on my front porch, lining up dozens of Pokemon
to fight against my neighbor's deck.</span></p><p><span>I've always dreamt that the cards would go to another good home with kids
who would treasure the cards as much as I have, obsessively sorting them
to build the best decks with the coolest cards.</span></p><p><span>One year, these cards traveled with me to a tournament on the morning of my
brother's birthday. I'd spent the whole evening crafting and preparing my deck to
destroy the competition -- I'd even gotten a new card, the </span><em><span>Typhlosion Prime</span></em><span>,
that I hoped would help me best them.</span></p><p><span>"You need sleeves to play with cards like that!"</span></p><p><span>"Sorry, but you have five copies of </span><em><span>Ponyta</span></em><span> in your deck.
You'll have to remove one to play."</span></p><p><span>Yesterday I sold my collection of Pokemon cards for $50.
As she left, the woman mentioned she knew some people who might be
interested in some of the old cards -- that she'd have an easy time
flipping them to make a lot of money.</span></p><p><span>I don't care.</span></p></section></div></div></article></main></body></html>
