The most underrated problem solving tool is to type out and explain your
thought process.
Start writing down questions to ask others; as you explain what you have
tried, you will begin to realize that there are more things left to try --
some of which being potential solutions.</span></p><p><span>Type your question into StackOverflow to submit; you'll be fearful of asking
the question.</span></p><p><span>Rank factors; always express factors as positive attributes. After generating
the table, the longest continuous line of check marks for each factor
determines the choice (though this can be gamed...)</span></p><p><span>State charts: easy to reason about state changes without the explosion of
state machines. These are hierarchical state machines, in a sense.</span></p><p><span>The Inversion Methods: The solution to many hard problems can be clarified by
re-expressing them in inverse form.</span></p><p><span>Crossline: structure your thoughts as you type and make cross-references.</span></p><p><a class="firn-external" href="https://fs.blog/mental-models/" target="_blank">mental models for making intelligent decisions</a></p><p><a class="firn-external" href="https://medium.com/disruptive-design/search?q=tools%20for%20systems%20thinkers" target="_blank">tools for systems thinkers</a><span></span><a class="firn-external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22747409" target="_blank">state machines for complex systmes</a><span></span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/TRIZ+for+Engineers%3A+Enabling+Inventive+Problem+Solving-p-9780470741887" target="_blank">enabling inventive problem solving</a><span></span><a class="firn-external" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ" target="_blank">analyzing and forecasting tool</a></p><p><a class="firn-external" href="https://untools.co/" target="_blank">tools for better thinking .</a></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="today&apos;s-js"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>today's js</span></span></h1><section><p><span>https://lea.verou.me/2020/05/todays-javascript-from-an-outsiders-perspective/

THe modern web is painful. Interfacing with js and node results in conflitts
between es and js versions, node incompatibilities, differnet import syntax
in different circumstances, etc. it's painful. How do you import with node?
without node? <script> tag or not to script? Where did the node modules go?
This is a good rant of questions and things to feature on the wbesite</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="record-of-a-living-being"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>record of a living being</span></span></h1><section><p><span>https://cinemasojourns.com/2020/03/29/akira-kurosawas-record-of-a-living-being/

anxiety can emerge easily from stress, resulting in anger, frustration and
other unhealthy forms of exerting such stress. this impacts other people,
organizations and processes as well. 
we have fear driven development : a concrete idea encouraging us to avoid
certain practices depending upon the specific approach</span></p><p><span>play to win, don't play not to lose; developing a unique selling proposition
means that you are no longer fighting with others, but rather striving to
come out ahead</span></p><p><span>awareness of such anxiety is the first step to take. with this awareness
comes conscious decision making, and with such decisions come wiser product
crafting and, in the end, better, more creative work</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="bootstrappable-builds"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>bootstrappable builds</span></span></h1><section><p><span>http://bootstrappable.org/

this is a general build philosophy addressing the chicken and egg problem --
to trust platforms, we must see how each part is produced from source, but we
do not have access to the source of compiled code when we run it against the
language they are compiling!

inversion :: avoiding stupidity is easier and better than being brilliant
doublespeak :: saying the opposite of what one means
theory of constraints :: focus on the bottleneck, the weakest point of the
system, always.
preference falsification :: lying to conform to the most socially acceptable
opinion at the time
mimetic teory of desire: rather than having our own desires, we imitate the
desires of others and pursue their ideas
mimetic theory of conflict :: similar = fight</span></p><p><span>left off on 10!</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="cool-cs"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>cool cs</span></span></h1><section><p><span>https://github.com/browserdotsys/vecchio ray tracing in one weekend :: looks
