#+TITLE: Wiki

This is my personal wiki, served at [[https://wiki.chvatal.com]].
I record my thoughts in the /org directory.

This website has been inspired by the following:
- [[https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html][Devine Lu Linvega's Blog]]
- [[https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes][Andy Matuschak's Notes]]
- [[https://tomcritchlow.com/][Tom Critchlow's Site]]
- [[https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/][Nikita Voloboev's Gitbook]]
- [[http://okmij.org/ftp/][Oleg's Notes]]
- [[https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/][Bruno Henriquez' Knowledge Base]]
- [[https://braindump.jethro.dev][Jethro's Braindump]]
and is in a state of continuous improvement.

The structure of this repository is no different from other sites served with [[gohugo.io][Hugo]].
The repository for [[https://github.com/jakechv/cortex][the template]] contains all of the presentation logic.
