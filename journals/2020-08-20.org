** 09:33 problems i want to solve
- unix problem -- using strings as a basis for the operating system abd.
  define type system as basis for the os.
- editing (kind of): editing text without using plaintext.
  projectional editors are interesting but not something im interested in working on or coding.
- information control and transparency
- personal info management and history logging
- inspiration engines and incoming content management
- minimal resource usage with web, mobile etc. protocols for this?
  definitely want to contribute but not sure if i should add to standard
