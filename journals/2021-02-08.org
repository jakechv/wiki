- stop consuming, stop producing! if you want to learn you have to put things into practice.
- Target something you want to replicate and reiterate it to others

*** Committment is a defense against the void

there is so much going on at once that it's hard to pace! we're driven to create and consume and keep up; it's nauseuous.
"the balance between willing to change and improve and knowing who you are is tricker than ever before". don't lose individuality by adopting the interests of others; copying the style of others means that you abandon your own. if you don't make a choice nothing ever happens - optimizing in the wrong way makes things existential!
committment isn't just necessary to get good; it's necessary for /peace of mind/ - it allows you to survive all of the optionality

you can't optimize perfectly for what people think - and as nice as email is it's hard to feel empty when feedback isn't empty! who are you with no notifications? if you know, you can't be disturbed.
