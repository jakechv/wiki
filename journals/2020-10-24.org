What is the future of the internet?
The need for global collectivity is super important; one of the biggest blockers is NAT traversal.
NAT :: Network Address Translation. A mechanism used to map from one IP address space to another to
redirect IP packets in transit. We must prevent every connected device from requiring a public IP,
so they should be freely redirected to our own private subnetworks from our router to the local devices connected to it.
