** 10:47 journal
starting a 'daily standup' or journal so i can better keep track of what i get done and want to do every day.

yesterday i did not do much, hence why i am starting this journal.
today i will:
- travel to osu and spend time with friends
- set up git crypt for my nixos configuration
  - full file encryption is fine, don't have to *just* encrypt secrets.
- generate a pgp key for jake@isnt.online and use it in fun places
- ship some cards
- clean my room and try to get rid of a couple of things
- solidify my plans for the rest of the semester.
