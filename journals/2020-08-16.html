<p>arrived in stockholm yesterday. its a bit intimidating to go shopping and all but i love the city! its very personable and its like corona doesn't exist (aside from the social distancing signs). i do have a bit of a cough but i don't think that's due to any sort of important illness.</p>
<p>I spent a few hours yesterday walking around town trying to become better antiquated with the city. I really want to learn more about street photography while I'm here â€“ this is the perfect opportunity to both navigate a city and hone my skills with my camera.</p>
<p>I also had some trouble buying groceries in the city. The machine failed on me twice and i'm not sure if it was my fault!</p></body></html>
