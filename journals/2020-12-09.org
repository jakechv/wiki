Maybe other people might find this useful, too.

    Contribute to someone else’s safety, health, or pleasure. Secure your own oxygen mask before helping others — so that you can help others.
    Do 1 thing at a time. Multitasking is counter-productive.
    Eat a moderate amount of a wide variety of foods. Eat breakfast. Reduce (but don’t completely eliminate) sugar and alcohol.
    Listen to even more kinds of music, even more often.
    Read even more kinds of text, even more often. Read more long-form than short-form.
    The mind is the body. Meditate, in some form, for at least 30 minutes each day. Walk at least 10,000 steps each day.
    Clean your body, clean your clothes, clean your home.
    Prefer craft and technique to tools. But do use the best tools, and take care of them.
    Doubt yourself — but not too much. Doubt yourself before doubting others, but do avoid confirmed fools.
    Nail the fundamentals. Be open to improvising around the fundamentals.
    “The shortest answer is doing the thing.” — Ernest Hemingway
    Habits are free. (That can be bad.) Be aware of your habits and break them if necessary, or even just to change perspective.
