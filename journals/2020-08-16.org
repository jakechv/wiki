** 21:45 first day at work
arrived in stockholm yesterday.
its a bit intimidating to go shopping and all but i love the city!
its very personable and its like corona doesn't exist (aside from the social distancing signs).
i do have a bit of a cough but i don't think that's due to any sort of important illness.

I spent a few hours yesterday walking around town trying to become better antiquated with the city.
I really want to learn more about street photography while I'm here -- this is the
perfect opportunity to both navigate a city and hone my skills with my camera.

I also had some trouble buying groceries in the city. The machine failed on me twice
and i'm not sure if it was my fault!
