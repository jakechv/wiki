I am currently starting my journal.
I'm hoping to make this a habit; catalogueing my thoughts at the end of every
day.
However, it's unclear whether I will have the self-discipline to keep this up.
I'll try my best!
I really enjoyed interacting with Brad -- he reminded me precisely why I find
technology so cool with his clear enthusiasm for everything in his office and
the tools he uses to accomplish his tasks. That newfound enthusiasm is something
I'm definitely missing, and is someting I'd like to add more to in my life.
