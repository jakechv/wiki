** 14:58 i have this picture
in my head of weaving through a futuristic, alternative landscape
to the tune of purity ring
through a battlefield, but it all feels so slow and peaceful
slowing down for me to not relish in, bt to
witness the destruction of society slowly and with chaos -
but yet with an artistic rhythm.
** 16:16 for daily standup - idea!
log all the commits
show you the commits during standup
can group into different projects

how can i track time on each of my tasks efficiently?
can this be implicitly measured with industry tools?
how can i make this data visible to me but not my employer?
  --> this is so important
