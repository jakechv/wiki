see aingle image at a time and tag it with multiple tags. nice ui shows you existing tags, more effort to add new one but still possible
images / video / text you've collected can be turned into a static site at a specific url and hosted easily

interview ppl!!! all the time. ask good questions. i loved being interviewed because it made me think and i want to do the same for others and do it /quickly/.
