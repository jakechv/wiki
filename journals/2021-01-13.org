** 11:46 log and daily standup
forgot to do this for the past few days... and i suppose it's not exactly the start of the day today either.
oh well.

Previously, I:
- Worked through all of the NixOS configuration ideas I had and formatted them,
  rephrasing in both my wiki and on github issues to map out future work
- Started to learn colemak on my keyboard

today I'm going to:
- Set up matrix, hosting both the web app and the server, on my VPS configuration
- Get through all of the mails in my inbox
- Fix my planck so that it always uses colemak so that I can continue to learn it
- Ship the cards that I sold a few days ago
- Hunt down my Google Fi SIM and deactivate it
- Evaluate how I want to deal with the 'TODOs' in my wiki
