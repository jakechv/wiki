<h3>Committment is a defense against the void</h3>

"the balance between willing to change and improve and knowing who you are is tricker than ever before". don't lose individuality by adopting the interests of others; copying the style of others means that you abandon your own. if you don't make a choice nothing ever happens - optimizing in the wrong way makes things existential! committment isn't just necessary to get good; it's necessary for <em>peace of mind</em> - it allows you to survive all of the optionality</p>
<p>you can't optimize perfectly for what people think - and as nice as email is it's hard to feel empty when feedback isn't empty! who are you with no notifications? if you know, you can't be disturbed.</p>
