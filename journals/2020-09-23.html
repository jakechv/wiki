<p>building an influencer communtiy is a lot like discovering new land</p>
<ul>
<li>build centralized economy, favoring few people</li>

<p>venture capital! none are part of the same company but portfolio can share aspects valuations are healthy, serial acquirers do so at a certain evaluation Danaher lean acquisition strategy doesn't apply to tech huge amount of expertise in the firm that you can unlock when they invest in you! think about SVs best practices and getting them out to millions of internet businesses</p>

<p>the way we build adn deploy software now is now where it will be we have regressed - harder to build a consumer startup! have to build platforms! standards are higher for what you have to show!</p>
<p>capital has moved to intellectual capital and intangible capital the best is that software that has been developed in house by the business</p>
<p>it's really easy to think about tangible capital, but terribly hard to value the intangible! hard to think about hte profitability of the business in its knowledge (how much is investment in future systems?) have to split out lines of business and categorize them</p>
<p>how much are you investing in a long lived technological advantage? how much does it cost to operate the business? it is so hard to measure the outputs of software engineering</p>

<li>the outsiders : case study of CEOS who are great capital allocators amazon probably most efficient allocators allocating scarce resources is the name of the game internally and externally the outcome for the company really depends on how good of a job they do! placing resources towards the rate of highest future return influences all businesses</li>
