** 00:16 Let's assume
that you have already found and read all of the content you're interested in learning or doing.
This means that you shouldn't expose yourself to new ideas or information.

Focus on learning and doing what you've thought about in the past!

Tomorrow I want to:
- Fix keyboard
- start FOSS android launcher (it shouldn't be too hard to clone the one I'm using now)
- send some emails and get to an inbox of 0
- make sure i can have my things picked up from the storage people
- think about my backup system and network; it doesn't feel very seamless...
Open this up tomorrow and get to work!
