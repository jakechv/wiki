** 17:18 you're allowed to do things
https://milan.cvitkovic.net/writing/things_youre_allowed_to_do/

this was a really interesting read; it's easy to forget just how much autonomy we have when we have flexible income.
self efficacy extends to cold emails, paying for opportunities, etc. and enables greater possibilities that we wouldn't
have had access to otherwise!

things to investigate:
- cold emailing is free. if i have a question i should always reach out!
- run surveys or ask those with larger followings to conduct them!
- run randomized control trials on yourself to see what works best
- host small gatherings about things you care about
- just, like, ask for things you want
- talk to anyone
- ask obvious questions
  - true clarification; might not truly be obvious
  - demonstrate interest
  - help others
- travel just to visit friends!
- move to live near friends!
- surgery for appearance or comfort
- buy task specific devices
- modify your stuff!
literally *reach out to anyone*; consequences are at worst rejection


things you should buy and use: these are some good recs
