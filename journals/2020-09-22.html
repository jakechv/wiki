<p>making trivial cleanups? are they useful or good?</p>
<p>small patches are important because people realize that they <strong>can</strong> change the kernel! on a practical level, they can tag a change on the kernel and say that they accomplished it</p>
<p>it's not possible to get into the kernel without starting out small and making mistakes</p>
<p>even trivial patches really do take time, as they often have trivial mistakes! they take a lot of time proportional to effort in the contribution, but it's so important for people to learn how to contribute to projects! don't stop making patches, even if those patches aren't the best. they're a good way to learn.</p>

<ul>
<li>defines a 'regular'</li>
<li>what does it mean to frequent the restaurant? what does it mean ot enjoy it?</li>
