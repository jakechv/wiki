<p>that you have already found and read all of the content you're interested in learning or doing. This means that you shouldn't expose yourself to new ideas or information.</p>
<p>Focus on learning and doing what you've thought about in the past!</p>
<p>Tomorrow I want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix keyboard</li>
<li>start FOSS android launcher (it shouldn't be too hard to clone the one I'm using now)</li>
<li>send some emails and get to an inbox of 0</li>
<li>make sure i can have my things picked up from the storage people</li>
<li>think about my backup system and network; it doesn't feel very seamless…</li>
</ul>
<p>Open this up tomorrow and get to work!</p>
