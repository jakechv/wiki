</ul>
<p>today I'm going to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up matrix, hosting both the web app and the server, on my VPS configuration</li>
<li>Get through all of the mails in my inbox</li>
<li>Fix my planck so that it always uses colemak so that I can continue to learn it</li>
<li>Ship the cards that I sold a few days ago</li>
<li>Hunt down my Google Fi SIM and deactivate it</li>
<li>Evaluate how I want to deal with the 'TODOs' in my wiki</li>
