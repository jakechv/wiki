** 15:28 depressing and empowering
i take solace in the fact that i can choose to kill myself at any moment. making the conscious decision not to do so means that i still have reason to live and motivation to work.
i didn't choose to be born but i'm choosing to be /alive/.
** 17:06 debugging is learning
valuable because its just focused learning!
if we empower others by forcing them to work thorugh their codebase without finding these bugs, we'll be able to help them in the saem way
i remember having a great experience with the bisecting haskell tool to find bugs in code based on how functions were executed; great experience.
wondering how we can generalize this experience and bring it to other progrmming languages; the generalization of these efforts, even if it means the tools are a bit less powerful, seems incredibly valuable -- and possible thanks to tools like the lang server protocol
