<p>i need to learn how to improve my health! here is how i can do that</p>

<p>nutrition! he experimented a lot with some crazy shit and wild research over the course of a year, learning more about the body</p>
<ol>
<li><p>weight focus</p>
<ul>
<li>weight is blunt instrument and barely associated iwth health</li>
<li>weight loss is sensitive and complex</li>
</ul>
<p>weight: bodies are 'full' batteries are adipose tissue and triglycerides stored within, stored by body to be burned for energy</p>
<ul>
<li><p>all discharge to synthesize ATP from ADP; some also goes to redox power</p></li>
<li><p>common to all life on earth! everything performs this active transport operation</p></li>
<li><p>four batteries</p>
<dl>
<dt>phosphocreatine system</dt>
<dd>super short term battery. buffers phosphate groups to quickly cycle ADP to ATP; attached to createne. athletes take createne supplements barely anything here but good for short bursts
</dd>
<dt>glycogen</dt>
<dd>short term battery. stored in liver and skeletal muscle. can hold 120 grams in liver, 400g in skeletal muscle, with about 4g in the blood. we get 4kcal/g from oxidation of glucose, so glycogen battery stores 2k kcal, or the base metabolic rate of an adult for 24h. not very energy dense and binds a lot of water
</dd>
<dt>adipose tissue</dt>
<dd>fat; long term body. dense high capacity battery pack. significantly more energy dense, 9 kcal/g for energy.
</dd>
<dt>lean body mass</dt>
<dd>when fasted, biochemistry burns lean body mass like muscle for fuel as a last resort
</dd>
</dl></li>
</ul>
<p>all are charged and discharged at all times cookie -&gt; glucose -&gt; bloodstream if too much glucose: anabolic pathways -&gt; glycogen in liver if in vast abundance: convert glycogen to fat catabolics: use creotine for first 3 seconds, glycogen for next 8-10 seconds, then ramp into 2 and 3 as heart rate, breathing rate and oxygen transport increases</p>
<p>moving energy around is expensive: creotene is cache, anaerobic is ram, and aerobic respiration is the disk, moving fatty acids through fatty tissue through the bloodstream but is super efficient storage wise</p>
<p>body weight is just a sum of the atoms; day to day fluctuations mostly due to water retention (in turn controlled by sodium, glycogen levels, horomones) + some stool we breathe out most of our weight in carbon dioxide! was triglyceride molecule in fat</p>
<p>combustion = weight loss cellular respiration: 'slow motion' combustion of ADP and ATP ATP Synthase traps 40% of energy in ATP, more efficient than internal 'motor' which operates at 25% lots of stuff happens in the chain: foot chopped into acetate and electrons are stripped, flow down to electron transport chain etc</p></li>
<li><p>Energy</p>
<p>humans have simple way of consuming energy - breakdown of food, narrow subset of organic molecules proteins, fats, carbs and molecules like alcohol cannot metabolize:</p>
<ul>
<li>celluluse/fiber, also a harbohydrate</li>
<li>hydrocarbons: only by internal combustion</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p>output</p>
<p><strong>not</strong> mostly from movement! we are super efficient with movement and it is expensive to just exist</p>
<ul>
<li>homeostasis</li>
<li>thermal regulation</li>
<li>respiration</li>
<li>heartbeat</li>
<li>brain/nerves</li>
<li>blood</li>
<li>protein synthesis</li>
<li>active transport</li>
</ul>
<p>basically the 'passive energy' of being human is far more expensive this is 'base metabolic rate' and we burn this for free every day common estimate for BMR for men: 10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) - 5 * age(y) + 5 this is a free win! workout is a drop in the bucket for weight. cv health is different but this workout has nothing to do with losing weight</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>introducing deficit</p>
<p>greater deficits could stress out, make hangry, and sacrifice lean body mass !!! good to lose maybe 1 lb per week to do this, 1g of fat about 9 kcal, adipose is ~87% lipids, so 3500 kcal is 1 lb of fat</p>
<p>this means target deficit of 500 kcal per day; can be much easier to make this up with cardio than with pure calorie restriction</p>
<p>helps to adopt 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule :: skip breakfast, eat only from 12 to 8 pm this controls appetite and reduces snacking</p></li>
<li><p>specific diet:w</p>
<p>low carb, mostly pescetarian avoid nearly all sources of sugar stopped drinking calories in any form regular cardio a few times of week, regular existance training improved a number of biomarkers supposedly</p>
<p>track:</p>
<ul>
<li>calories in food</li>
<li>energy output</li>
</ul>
<p>compute actual weight loss input/output!</p>
<p>discrepancy varies iwth the amount of carbohydrates in diet eating increases glycogen levels, glycogen soaks up water</p>
<p>body composition: need to better understand specific body composition</p></li>
<li><p>simple diet recs</p>
<ul>
<li>eat from 12 to 8pm only</li>
<li>do not drink any calories</li>
<li>avoid sugar</li>
<li>exclude carb heavy sugar</li>
<li>lesser extent: natural sugars, berries are ok</li>
<li>meat: chicken &gt; beef/pork
<ul>
<li>ethical: intelligent large animals</li>
<li>envionmnetal: large footprint, lots of deforestation</li>
<li>read meat associated with some cause for concern</li>
<li>lots of diseases are zootopic and come from livestock</li>
</ul></li>
<li>only shop on outer walls of the store, stay clear of the cetner! michael pollan heuristic</li>

<li><p>Comments</p>
<ul>
<li>french doctor or something
<ul>
<li>main problem is sugar, not fat</li>
<li>eat as many veggies as you can</li>
<li>as many fish as you want (bake not cook!!)</li>
<li>eat meat as if you had to hunt it with a bow</li>
<li>ban every processed food, sauce, appetizer; if you wouldn't need a single ingredient don't eat it</li>
<li>learn how to cook plz</li>
</ul></li>
<li>very strong measures correlating with dexa scans:
<ul>
<li>waist just above belly button; no muscle and principal deposit of internal body fat take body weight and waist size every day</li>
</ul></li>
<li>weight track
<ul>
<li>must have a diet to weight less</li>
<li>must have distinct diet to lose weight</li>
<li>most do low impact cardio, like walking several miles a day</li>
<li>must do resistance training</li>
<li>these accomplish:
<ul>
<li>stable weight</li>
<li>take off weight</li>
<li>increase background caloric burn</li>
<li>encourage lean body mass loss over fat loss</li>
</ul>
you must develop a routine and not vary from that routine for the rest of your life</li>
</ul></li>
<li>eating japanese is easy
<ul>
<li>bowl of rice</li>
<li>several small sides</li>
<li>small cup of miso soup can be boring but helps stick to consistent diet <a href="https://elemental.medium.com/ichiju-sansai-how-to-construct-meals-like-a-japanese-centennial-7cb878366994">https://elemental.medium.com/ichiju-sansai-how-to-construct-meals-like-a-japanese-centennial-7cb878366994</a></li>
