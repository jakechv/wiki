<h2>21:46 static analysis in java enterprise applications</h2>
<p>these are generally notes on notes, i guess <a href="https://pldi20.sigplan.org/details/pldi-2020-papers/66/Static-Analysis-of-Java-Enterprise-Applications-Frameworks-and-Caches-the-Elephants">the paper</a>, it's from PLDI 2020 Static analysis of enterprise is hard due to dependency injection, inversion of control, and general obfuscation of bytecode; code generation techniques are also highly leveraged. The static analyzer for such applications should adopt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foundational static analysis framework</li>
<li>Framework independenet layer that understands the enterprise application concepts</li>
<li>per framework mapping to translate details of framework into concepts at the framework level</li>
</ul>
<p>â€¦ I really don't care about Java. I'm closing this paper.</p></body></html>
