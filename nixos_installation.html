wanted to try a new system: </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://nixos.org" target="_blank">NixOS</a><span>. It's an operating system
centered around system configuration -- a DevOps tool and
a way to manage configuration files as well as a proper
Linux-based operating system.</span></p><p><span>I did have a bit of trouble installing it so I wanted to
catalogue the process here.</span></p><p><span>To help with the installation, I referenced </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://gist.github.com/domenkozar/b3c945035af53fa816e0ac460f1df853" target="_blank">Domen Kozar's instructions</a><span>,</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://github.com/jethrokuan/nix-config" target="_blank">Jethro's configuration</a><span> and </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://github.com/kylesferrazza/nix/" target="_blank">Kyle's configuration</a><span>. I also made substantial
use of the </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://nixos.org/nixos/manual" target="_blank">NixOS manual</a><span> and its instructions. I'll be summarizing steps
taken by each of these articles; refer to the NixOS manual or the instructions
if you'd like more information about the abbreviated steps.</span></p><p><span>As the title says, I installed </span><code>NixOS 20.03</code><span> on the Dell XPS 9370 i7 UHD.
I can't guarantee that these instructions will work for your system.
My current configuration, including some of the code mentioned
in this article, can be found </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://github.com/jakechv/nix-cfg" target="_blank">here</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Make sure that you have a flash drive handy with a capacity greater than 2 gigabytes.
My first go used installation media that didn't have the entire ISO written to it
and I had issues booting.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="setup"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Setup</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="recovery-disk"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Recovery Disk</span></span></h2><section><p><span>First remember to create a recovery disk for Windows.

offers no real advantage over the minimal installation disk. You'll be using

    Use ext4 if you want something simple and reliable;
    use btrfs or zfs if you want something advanced.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The swap partition should be formatted as a swap partition.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="mounting-and-installing"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Mounting and Installing</span></span></h2><section><p><span>This system's a UEFI system, so we'll have to mount two partitions.
Mount your main partition to </span><code>/mnt</code><span>:

Most of the defaults are fine, but you'll want to install a sane editor
to make it immediately usable. I'd suggest </span><code>vim</code><span> or </span><code>nvim</code><span>.
You'll probably also want </span><code>git</code><span> and </span><code>wget</code><span> for saving your configuration or
cloning that of another. Add these to </span><code>environment.systemPackages</code><span>:</span></p><pre class="language-nix"><code class="language-nix">environment.systemPackages = [
  nvim wget git
];
</code></pre><p><span>You might also want a better program for configuring networking.
If you're accustomed to Network Manager, add</span></p><pre class="language-nix"><code class="language-nix">~services.networkmanager.enable = true;
</code></pre><p><span>to the configuration.</span></p><p><span>You should probably add a user as well.
There's a template for user configuration in the file, but try amending it:</span></p><pre class="language-nix"><code class="language-nix">users.users.{username} = {
  isNormalUser = true;
  home = "/home/{username}";
  extraGroups = [ "wheel" "networkmanager" ];
};
</code></pre><p><span>You'll want to add yourself to the </span><code>"networkmanager"</code><span> group
if you're using Network Manager in lieu of wpa_supplicant.
'Wheel' will allow this user to use </span><code>sudo</code><span>.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="first-boot"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>First Boot</span></span></h1><section><p><span>You're ready to install and boot the system!
