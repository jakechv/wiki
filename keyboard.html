explicitly document this somewhere
dont be afraid to draw out specific layout!!

obviously best action to take is planck or split keyboard, but the next action
to take is changing the keyboard layout to radically change the way the
fingers move as we type!
do not place constraint on how many keys are relocated
places on this site layout the q**lw* layouts for optimizing for various things,
one keeps zxcv in place for greater effeffectiveness. consider using one of
these as opposed to colemak or somethign for better effectivenes
