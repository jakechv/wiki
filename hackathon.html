Below this, there are lots of bubbles pseudorandomly scattered throughout the page. Their sizes are by default weighted by the number of upvotes on the comment, but they can be arranged by number of comments in the thread branching from the comment or some other metrics (TBD).</span></p><p><span>Each bubble has the username, number of upvotes, and the prefix of the comment. They may have smaller bubbles visible to demonstrate the next layer of comments in the tree.</span></p><p><span>Clicking on one of these bubbles does one of two things (not sure yet):</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Moves the bubble to the top right of the screen</span></p></li><li><p><span>Replaces the text of the reddit post with that of the comment opened</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Either way, the user now has access to a back button to go 'back up' in the tree (we define clicking on a bubble as 'going down' the tree), and they also can see all of the comments descended from the currently open comment as first-class bubbles.</span></p><p><span>Each of these pages will also havte a bubble with a plus sign on it in the bottom right of the page; clicking this opens a bubble that fills most of the screen, with the comment or post you're commenting on featured as a smaller bubble above it (perhaps it's visible as a semicircle under this bubble?). You can then make a reddit comment using the usual reddit facilities for this.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="production"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Production</span></span></h2><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="mvp"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>MVP</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>Visit a specific url on the reddit tree view website to open a reddit thread.</span></p></li><li><p><span>View the post and each comment in a bubble.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Click a bubble to view the next level of comments.</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="enhanced-ux"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Enhanced UX</span></span></h3><section><ul><li><p><span>Tree view can be accessed by prefixing a reddit URL thread with our URL.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Post bubbles are sized proportionally to their number of upvotes or some other ranking metric.

current solutions for persisting livecoding information require
recording, which compresses all of the structural information associated with the music, or meticulously copying and pasting code then saving it all.</span></p><p><span>We can do better!</span></p><p><span>A 'recording' mode for a live coding environment could be implemented.</span></p><p><span>To start the recording mode, a new branch is created.
Every time the file is updated and re-run, it's recorded as a git commit in a project's commit history.
The commit message has notation demonstrating how long a certain commit was played (time from start of recording to first commit or from the last commit to the current one).</span></p><p><span>When done recording, you can switch back to the main branch. The new branches are identified by a particular notation in the branch name to demonstrate that they were automatically created.</span></p><p><span>These recordings can be:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Played back. A menu is exposed to 'play' each of the created branches.
  When a branch is played, its first commit is run through the music interpreter for a specified amount of time, then the new commit is checked out and re-run; this is identical to a user manually editing the file and updating the played music, and tracks will only update if the code has been changed for them.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Exported: this can be done in the same way tracks are played back.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Converted to linear tracks. You can 'export' a branch to a linear arrangement to make it easier to edit and turn into a complete song without having to record it! This process generates the appropriate pauses in between the different parts of the music and loops to ensure that the different segments of the track are run at the right time and in the right order.
  This allows artists to take live coding projects that have been performed. convert them into full-fledged tracks, and export them without having to perform them.</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="spell-check-hook"><span class="firn-headline-keyword firn-headline-keyword__DONE">DONE </span><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Spell Check Hook</span></span></h1><section><p><span>I hate improper spelling or formatting.
