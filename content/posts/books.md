## favorites {#favorites}


### Blame! {#blame}

an incredible navigation of dystopia in a world as a city


### Scott Pilgrim {#scott-pilgrim}

Such a joyful adventure! Follows a kid out of college and two old to grow up as he battles his new girlfriend's evil exes and navigates regrets, living without limits and his future. Thematic exploration changes with the art style.


## others i have read {#others-i-have-read}

ghost in the shell -- too hard to follow, too much dialogue, not a big fan of the art style
