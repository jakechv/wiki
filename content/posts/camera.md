Notes about cameras.


## Configuration {#configuration}

I've sold all of my Canon DSLR gear to downgrade to a lighter setup.
I'm now using a Fujifilm X-T3 with the 23mm f2 and 35mm f2 weather resistant lenses.


## Projects {#projects}

[convert a camera to use instax wide film !! this is super cool. try this out when u have a sec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U88i-85m%5FjE&app=desktop). instax wide mods are super neat and this seems like a fun project to pursue.
