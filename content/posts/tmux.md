Tmux is a terminal multiplexer,
allowing one to track multiple groups of terminals
and terminal environments in a[ Terminal UI]({{< relref "terminal_ui" >}}) application.

It's most often used as a window manager on Unix-based
systems without a GUI in conjunction with programs like [Vim]({{< relref "vim" >}}).

Unfortunately, the tmux configuration language is very limited,
but it provides the right facilities for keymapping and managing windows.
