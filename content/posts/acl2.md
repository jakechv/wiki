ACL2 is a theorem prover based on Common Lisp commonly used for the verification of hardware.

[The wiki](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/manuals/current/manual/index-seo.php/ACL2%5F%5F%5F%5FTOP?path=3486) is an excellent source of information on the language.
[This work](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236578406%5FVerified%5FAIG%5FAlgorithms%5Fin%5FACL2) discusses the verification of AIG graph representations of boolean functions.
[This page](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/acl2-programming-exercises1.html) has good programming exercises for ACL2.

ACL2 is often used in [Emacs]({{< relref "emacs" >}}) with [Proof General](http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/htmlshow.php?title=Proof+General+user+manual&file=releases%2FProofGeneral%2Fdoc%2FProofGeneral%2FProofGeneral%5F2.html).
