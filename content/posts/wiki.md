Wikis are tree-based tools for representing
hierarchies of information.

This personal wiki is the one I maintain.
Others refer to personal wikis as _Digital Gardens_,
_Brain Dumps_, or _Personal Libraries_.

The source of this wiki can be found at <https://github.com/jakechv/wiki>.


## Motivation {#motivation}


### Organization {#organization}

I needed a way to better organize my ideas.
Administering structure to my data was a good way
to do this, and org-mode provides a good facility for this.
Further, the constraints administered by the website motivate
me to better organize my notes as they're visible to the public;
without this structure the notes won't even render properly.


### Accessibility {#accessibility}

I'd like my notes to be easily visible to anyone.
It allows me to easily share my thoughts and perspectives with
friends or colleagues.


### Publicity {#publicity}

This portal also enables recruiters or future collaborators to
learn more about me, my skills and my interests. Perhaps I can
build a following, inspire someone, or find an interesting job
opportunity if someone stumbles upon this wiki.


## Design {#design}

: [Web Design]({{< relref "web_design" >}}),[Design]({{< relref "design" >}})

The design of this wiki takes after the principles of simple and minimal as discussed.
I introduce additional logic for the multi-pane browsing as I feel that it's more conducive
to consuming information than the typical browser structure and it adds a unique feel to the site.
[Here](https://github.com/jakchv/cortex) is the template I use to publish this wiki.
I may consider other templates or alternative views in the future,
and will continue iterating on this design,
but I plan to keep this template around.


## References {#references}

I've taken inspiration from several others who maintain wikis.

-   [Tommy Morriss](https://github.com/tommy-mor) first introduced me to the idea with his personal (private) wiki.
-   [Jethro](https://jethro.dev) has easily accessible articles and templates that I've made use of to put this together.
-   [100 Rabbits]({{< relref "100_rabbits" >}}) publish all of their notes and information in a custom wiki framework.
    <https://github.com/logseq/logseq> is a cool framework that syncs with github
