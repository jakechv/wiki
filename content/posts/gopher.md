Gopher is a former rival of HTTP.
It's a simple, plaintext protocol for serving files.

[A description of the protocol.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher%5F%28protocol%29)

why is gopher not commonly used as a protocol for corporate intranets? why
have gopher, hypergopher, gopher+ been entirely abandoned? gopher does not
