## web hostility {#web-hostility}

[article](https://neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web/)
"Facebook is at odds with the open web that I love and defend..."
Netscape Navigator (small internet) -> big internet!
The modern web is being destroyed -- personalized content, growth hacking,
social media activation, CMS and user experience. These websites are not
built to appreciate the visitor -- they are constructed to make the user a
customer. Cookies bad! Small blogging good!


## fun sites {#fun-sites}

-   <https://milk.com>
    This individual is staking their claim over their corner of the internet and doing so strongly.
    Mimu is a cool collection of programatically generated music demos as well.
