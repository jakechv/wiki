Window managers are programs that allow a user to interface with their computer.
I currently use the [EXWM]({{< relref "exwm" >}}) window manager, but I've used [Bspwm]({{< relref "bspwm" >}}), i3 and herbstluftwm in the past.
On MacOS and Windows, this is your standard user interface, just as it is with Gnome or another desktop management service in Linux.
