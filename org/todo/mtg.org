#+title: my relationship with magic the gathering

i've been playing magic the gathering on and off for about ten years. my
relationship with the game has changed over the years, of course -- starting
as something that resembles a board game, my understanding of the game
adapted and i became a cpllector, then a competitor, then a collector again.
now, i primarily hold onto my cards as a memory of a game i once had more
time to enjoy, hoping that i will make the time to play it again.

i've always been obsessed with collecting.
