* Working Effectively
[[https://www.stevestreeting.com/2010/09/04/work-2-0/][article]]
- Problem: staying 'in the zone' is just not healthy or effective for a
  programmer! However, long periods of concentration are vital for a
  programmer to better understand their code and succeed. This crazy
  dedication helps develop unhealthy habits and can prevent you from
  properly focusing.

- Concentration periods are the most important part of programming. Losing
  concentration means losing all context, and losing all context means that
  you'll spend lots of time reorienting yourself and entering a stronger
  period of focus.

- It's difficult to adjust, and this leads to substantially decreased
  productivity.

To improve:
1. Embrace interruptions. Learn to accept interruptions and avoid giving up
through them.
2. Maintain context outside of your head at all times. Always explicitly
comment and track what you're doing, teh decisions you're making. etc.
Externalizing thoughts can help you clarify them! Every so often, make sure
to record these (the author does this at 30 minute intervals).
3. Ignore tangental issues. Focus on the singular current task and don't
worry about things that could get you sidetracked! Write those down with a
ticket system that's fast, lightweight and agnostic to the amount of detail
put into these thoughts. The most important thing to do is to put this idea
away until it can be summoned in a future context.
4. Always know of the one thing you will do next.
5. Prioritize negatively :: assume baseline that you will not do any of the
tasks, then assess the negative outcomes of not doing each one. Perform the
task that will have the most negative outcome first.
6. Recognize the benefits of breaks. Breaks have great benefits, encourage
better health, and can offer a new context from which the problem can be
tackled!
