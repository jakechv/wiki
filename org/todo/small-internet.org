#+title: the small internet

http is a bloated protocol.
any visit to the website of a large company will tell you this. significant
sizes of applications (often over 5 mb!), load times, and the constant
reminder to consent to cookies are all emblematic of what our internet has
become -- a service hostile to its users for the sake of profit. practically 
every website you visit tracks your information to collect both analytics and
personal data, assembling a profile of you that can be sold to advertisers,
government agencies and whoever else wants a cut of your data.

this is a new protocol for browsing the internet founded by solderpunk.
it's designed only to serve data, and intends to foster a friendlier internet 
-- one in which arbitrary information can't be passed from consumer to producer no 
matter what the motivation.
