Hugo is the static site generator I use to maintain my web spaces, including this site.


## Themes {#themes}

[Hugo News](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugonews/), an imitation of Hacker News for a personal bookmarking website. Sharing all of my bookmarks is a good idea!
[The Roots](https://themes.gohugo.io/the-roots-home/), a theme for listing site contents as directories. Similar to a file server interface for the web, but with more customization.


## Tools {#tools}
