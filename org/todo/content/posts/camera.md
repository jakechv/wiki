Notes about cameras.


## Configuration {#configuration}

I've sold all of my Canon DSLR gear to downgrade to a lighter setup.
I'm now using a Fujifilm X-T3 with the 23mm f2 and 35mm f2 weather resistant lenses.


## Projects {#projects}

[Convert a camera to use Instax wide film!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U88i-85m%5FjE&app=desktop) This is super cool. try this out when you have some time.
