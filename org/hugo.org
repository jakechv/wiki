#+TITLE: Hugo

Hugo is the static site generator I use to maintain my web spaces, including this site.


* Themes
[[https://themes.gohugo.io/hugonews/][Hugo News]], an imitation of Hacker News for a personal bookmarking website. Sharing all of my bookmarks is a good idea!
[[https://themes.gohugo.io/the-roots-home/][The Roots]], a theme for listing site contents as directories. Similar to a file server interface for the web, but with more customization.
* Tools
[[https://themes.gohugo.io//theme/hugo-theme-codex/blog/math-typesetting/][Math Typesetting]]
