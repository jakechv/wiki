#+TITLE: Bspwm

BSPWM is a binary space partitioning window manager.

By default, it opens windows in a pattern resembling the Fibonacci sequence, but it's an incredibly configurable platform that a variety of others have written tools for.

It doesn't control its own keymappings; messaging is managed entirely by `bspc`. Users typically also use XHKD to map keys for the window manager.
