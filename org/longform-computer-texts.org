Title: Long-form Texts on Interesting Details of Computers

Link: https://deterministic.space/several-months-of-reading-material.html

It seems especially recently I’ve come across more and more long-form texts
(think: hour-long blog posts; free books; series of posts). I especially like
the ones that go into the very fine details of some niche topic and maybe also
ramble a bit about completely unrelated but highly entertaining asides. And
while I will probably never have enough time to read them all, I decided to at
least collect some of them here for future reference. I’ll do my best to add
summaries, and to update this list semi-regularly.

“Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists[19]” by Alexis Beingessner

(~180 pages; archived[20])

The premise of this book is that writing a linked list is a beginner’s exercise
in C but quite difficult to get right in Rust. So it takes that as an
opportunity to do just what the title says: It teaches you Rust by implementing
a linked list type in Rust, in five (as of April 2020) different ways.

Niches: data structures; linked lists; rust; smart pointers

“Programming Algorithms[21]” by Vsevolod Domkin

(~300 pages; archived[22])

Book covering a lot of different data structures and algorithms. “Its aim is to
systematically explain how to write efficient programs and, also, the approaches
and tools for determining why the program isn’t efficient enough.”

Niches: data structures; algorithms; lisp

“Aspects of Rust” by multiple people

Several stand-alone posts by various people whose only connection is that they
cover nice aspects of Rust.

Niches: rust

    your function to return, the compiler can go back and fill in the blanks.

One of the main features of the Rust language is the concept of ownership and
lifetimes. This series of posts by Niko Matsakis, one of the designers of the
Rust language, is about the theory and practical implementation of a revamped
and more complete way of this in the Rust compiler. It starts in early 2016 and
goes all the way to after they feature landed (end of 2018).
