* Tricks

* Writing a Git Commit Message
[[https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/][Article Reference]]

- Concise and consistent length and form
- Communicate clear context about a change to fellow developers.
  Ensure that other developers understand *why* a change was made.
** Rules
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
  if the body is to be used.
- Limit subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize subject line
- Do not end with period
- Use imperative mood; I 'do' this.
  Rationale: If applied, the commit will change these aspects of the code.
  Git's own built-in conventions use this form.
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain 'what' and 'why' as necessary

* Repositories
- GitHub :: I use this; Microsoft is bad but the community is good
- Sourcehut :: Minimal free software repository. I would use this if the developer weren't an egotistical BDFL.
- Gitea :: Open source git repository; self host it
