    worth noting: this does not
    - a window manager with a lot of features and functionality
    - no 'default config'; must implement everything yourself,
    though comes with a nice default settings thing

    ideas : changing the classname by identification in the bspwm tree!
    ' sticky' scratchpad : will switch monitors only if the desktop is swapped with the other monitor.
    personal policy - 'scratchbad when opened occupies the biggest window'
    sticky normal terminal window (with tmux, via byobu) to the scratchpad is much more useful and allows for a single terminal window to be kept open rather than having to use many

    read on this!

    http://thedarnedestthing.com/bspwm
    idea : have window actions focus and place the window on the main window of the
    target desktop.

    a swap monitor action is very cool; may want to either retain or swap monitor
    focus independent of this! depending on the direction of the hotkey relative to
    the monitor which has focus.if key action points to opposite monitor, swap the
    desktop moving the focus with the desktop; else, retain focus on the current
    monitor while cycling the desktop

    toggling the dock! this is much more distraction free (through conky) as opposed
    to a continuously updating status line at the top or bottom of the screen. conky
    is super beautiful and configuring it would besuper useful. run conky above the
    desktop windows via xdotool as per sdothum's articles

    https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/1jubyi/arch_bspwm_never_going_back_to_xmonad/

    this seems like hte most useful and powerful way to go in terms of a system
    configuration. make sure to use this one in the future.

    * i3 (currently using)
    - simple
    - intuitive, easy to configure, no recompilation required
    - however, it is difficult to configure some things and aothers get very complicated

    * herbstluftwm
    http://thedarnedestthing.com/herbstluftwm
    things it can do: (see sdothum here: http://thedarnedestthing.com/herbstluftwm%20workflow)
    - dynamic window placement to balance frames
    - dynamic window focus to avoid empty frame focus on application close
    - distraction free monocle layout proportions (versus fullscreen mode)
    - automatic desktop layout restore on focus and monitor swap*
    - quick monitor and frame swapping with focus directions
    - hide/unhide windows per desktop
    - pulsating borders to indicate overlapped windows
    - virtual monitors to show/hide the conky system information panel
    - single status bar to follow monitor focus and hint monitor geometry width
    - blur background if a window is present on the desktop
    note that monitor geometries are global when set.
    honestly his explanation is pretty complicated: there are a lot of things that can be done without this complex configuration
    can have a status bar that follows the monitor focus! killing the status bar isn't super effective, but using xdotool to manage the visibility of the panels seems muh more palatable

    check out his dotfiles for more information on this
    http://thedarnedestthing.com/herbstluftwm%20juggling

    * XMonad
    cool because it is written in and configured with haskell
    from my rough understanding, this is another manual tiling window manager (not automatic like bspwm)

    idea : rather than manually moving the window in between panels, shifting all of the workspaces 'one to the right' or 'one to the left' to refocus the panel u want at the center seems super valuable! this means that u dont have to reconfigure all of the stuff displayed at any given time)
    not sure if this is worthwhile as opposed to other things : bspwm doesn't do
    anythign other than window management, unlike other programs that may not
    integrate very well into the existing shell.

    benefits:
    - extensive multimonitor support
    - stable and feature rich
    - easy to configure and extend

    drawbacks:
    - huge
    - fractured into many different libraries
    - terrible floating layer that cannot always be avoided
    - using haskell (though this is also a pro!!)
    * dmenu
    rofi or dmenu ? i think that dmenu is worth trying - i like that it does not
    block anything on the screen and appears at the top instead
    http://thedarnedestthing.com/dmenu
    http://thedarnedestthing.com/dmenu2
    byobu ?? https://www.byobu.org/
    * diversifying systems
    you should probably install and set up multiple operating systems - one
    'experimental' one, with other 'stable' partitions in case the unstable one
    really messes up
