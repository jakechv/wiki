#+title: Wiki

Wikis are tree-based tools for representing
hierarchies of information.

This personal wiki is the one I maintain.
Others refer to personal wikis as /Digital Gardens/,
/Brain Dumps/, or /Personal Libraries/.

The source of this wiki can be found at [[https://github.com/jakechv/wiki]].

* Motivation
** Organization
I needed a way to better organize my ideas.
Administering structure to my data was a good way
to do this, and org-mode provides a good facility for this.
Further, the constraints administered by the website motivate
me to better organize my notes as they're visible to the public;
without this structure the notes won't even render properly.
** Accessibility
I'd like my notes to be easily visible to anyone.
It allows me to easily share my thoughts and perspectives with
friends or colleagues.
** Publicity
This portal also enables recruiters or future collaborators to
learn more about me, my skills and my interests. Perhaps I can
build a following, inspire someone, or find an interesting job
opportunity if someone stumbles upon this wiki.
* Design
- tags :: [[file:web_design.org][Web Design]],[[file:design.org][Design]]
The design of this wiki takes after the principles of simple and minimal as discussed.
I introduce additional logic for the multi-pane browsing as I feel that it's more conducive
to consuming information than the typical browser structure and it adds a unique feel to the site.
[[https://github.com/jakchv/cortex][Here]] is the template I use to publish this wiki.
I may consider other templates or alternative views in the future,
and will continue iterating on this design,
but I plan to keep this template around.
* References
I've taken inspiration from several others who maintain wikis.
- [[https://github.com/tommy-mor][Tommy Morriss]] first introduced me to the idea with his personal (private) wiki.
- [[https://jethro.dev][Jethro]] has easily accessible articles and templates that I've made use of to put this together.
- [[file:../people/100_rabbits.org][100 Rabbits]] publish all of their notes and information in a custom wiki framework.
  https://github.com/logseq/logseq is a cool framework that syncs with github
