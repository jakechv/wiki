#+TITLE: React

React is made by facebook or something.

* My development practices
Program as functionally as possible!
- Always use functional components. Never classes.
- Never use 'let' or 'var'; only 'const'.

* Hook Tips
- useMemo for expensive computations. It's magic
- useHook is a replacement for most UX logic
- useEffect is used to replace any rerendering in response to dependency changes; this is primarily useful for making requests when the user takes an action (thus changing props)
* Tips

- Always use capital letters for React components, and always use React component syntax to call them. It's okay if this means declaring a constant with a capital letter; that's expected and idiomatic in this case, even if it feels inconsistent.
