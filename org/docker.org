#+TITLE: Docker

Docker is a system for managing containers on a system.
Containers offer a consistent, reusable software configuration.

By running your code in a virtual machine rather than on 'bare metal',
you're preventing the code from interacting with the main machine's configuration
or any other virtual machines that may be running applications.

This prevents the tools from damaging any other configurations
and allows tools with contradictory configurations to communicate.

Containerization does away with virtualization by running off of the
existing operating system rather than running virtual machines, instead
installing compatible software suites in 'containers' that have access
to some parts of the main machine but that don't conflict with it.
